Hi! I'm Sam, Co-Founder and CEO of [Pickup Music](https://pickupmusic.com), an independent education technology company based in Los Angeles.

I started Pickup Music while studying jazz guitar in New York City. From 2015-2018, I grew Pickup Music to become the leading online community of musicians with over a million Instagram followers. It has since evolved into the top provider of music education with over 20,000 members.

I lead the content, curriculum, and engineering teams at Pickup Music.
