It's been a while since I had my own website.

The purpose of this website is:

- for you to read, listen and or maybe learn something
- for me to lean how to make a website so I can better work with engineers
- for me to have a place to write

Things I've enjoyed learning more about so far:

- Git
- Next.js and React
- Tailwind CSS
- Cursor
