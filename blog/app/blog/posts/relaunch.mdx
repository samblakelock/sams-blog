It's been a while since I had my own website.

The purpose of this website is:
- for you to read, listen and or maybe learn something
- for me to lean how to make a website so I can better work with engineers

Things I've enjoyed learning more about:
- Git
- Next.JS and React
- Tailwind

Areas I would like to learn more about:
- Devops

Areas of the site I would like to improve:
- Images & embeds
- Further CMS capabilities

Thanks for stopping by!
